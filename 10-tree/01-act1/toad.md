The rock toad is blocking Jerry's way on the stage. Did you talk to it?

# I did
Did you talk to it so many times that it becomes angry and stomps dropping the styrofoam chestnuts.

# I have the chestnuts
Look at them in your inventory.

# Nostrils
They will fit into the toad's nostrils.

# It won't let me closer
Did you find the switch ^[ Move the scenery and flick on the switch. ]?

# The voice tube
Speak to the tube. They will light the toad. Act while he is blinded.

# And?
While the toad is blinded from the light stick the chestnuts into its nostrils.
