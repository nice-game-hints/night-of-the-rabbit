Jerry is back at Mousewood. Now it is night. Open the fifth portal.

# Where it is
You teleported right next to it. Examine the big old tree stump. Not just the hole, also the stump.

# Four openings?
There are four openings in the stump. They should be filled with something.

# With what?
Four ambers.

# Where do I find them?
Remember the odd crystal statues located around Mousewood?

# Yes
Those had ambers in them. Go fetch them.

# How to get the amber?
Use the sound carrier on the crystal statues.

# It does not work
You have to take a sound into the carrier first.

# Where?
From the hole in the big old tree stump. Use the sound carrier there first.

# Where are they?
Near the four other portals:
 - At the swamp, near Kitsune's portal.
 - At the treetops
 - At the first portal, in the woods
 - Behind the town hall

# I have the ambers
Put them into the openings in the big old tree stump. [Open the door.](030-door.md)
