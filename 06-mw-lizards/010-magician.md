The magician is at his home. But he is caught in a bottle on the shelf. Talk to him.

# I am at the shelf
Now, free him.

# How?
You find everything you need from the shelf.

# Like?
What's in the bag ^[ Open the bag with the nail. ]?

# It's...
... corn kernel. Okay...

# What to do with it?
Did you notice the shelf is almost falling off. There is a sunlight gap.

# I found it
Now, could you use the corn to separate the shelf.

# How?
Stick the corn kernel into the gap.

# It is there
Make it pop!

# Pop?
Heat it.

# How?
Take the monocle and put it in front of the gap with the kernel. The kernel will pop and the shelf breaks.
