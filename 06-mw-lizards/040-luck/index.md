[Stop Ludwig from using all his money.](010-ludwig.md)

# He sleeps now
Did you [visit the magician](../010-magician.md), already?

# I have the bottle, yes
Great, capture the lizard into the bottle.

# How?
Did you notice he is really lucky?

# Is he?
He always gets the white ball when you ask him to tell his own fortune. He dances, as the ball tells him to do.

# Okay
[Get that white ball.](020-white-ball.md)

# I have the white ball
The orders in the ball don't suit the situation well. Modify them.

# Whit what?
You have the blue juice keg sticker: "Take the jug for some good luck."

# Neat!
Stick the blue sticker on the ball and put it back to the drum hatch.

# He won't let me
You have to distract him, again.

# So...
This time ask a fortune tell for Jerry. While he ponders the ball move pretty flower. The hatch is again open and he is trying to eat Buzzy. Put the white ball with the blue sticker back into the drum hatch.

# It is there!
Great. Now, ask him to tell a fortune about himself. He always gets the white ball.

# A jug
Well, you just happen to have a jug, don't you? Give him one of the bottles.
