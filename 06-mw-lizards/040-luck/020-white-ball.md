The luck lizard (at the swamp) always gets the white ball when you ask him to tell his own fortune. He dances, as the ball tells him to do.

# Yes he does
During that all time the drum hatch is open.

# Oh..
That his your change.

# How?
When the hatch is open, jam it open with the prize beet root.

# He doesn't let me
Could he be distracted?

# With?
Buzzy! Touch the pretty flower. He tries to eat buzzy.

# But the hatch is not open
The trick lies in doing these both at the same time.

# Same time?
First ask him to read his own fortune. While he is dancing touch the pretty flower. While he is reaching for Buzzy you can jam the hatch with the beet root. He will throw the white ball and it will drop to the ground. Pick it up.
