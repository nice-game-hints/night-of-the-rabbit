The odd stranger in the town hall is acting weirdly. Talk to him. He knows you are a human child and thus do not have any property.

# Well, I don't!
But _he_ doesn't have to know about it.

# Hmm...
Use you illusion magic on him. Use fox's cunning spell on him to get to talk with him like grown-ups do.

# Talking
Just keep on signing his contracts. He will celebrate the contracts with taking a sip from his sparkling wine bottle.

# I'm out of money
Say that "the price for acorns and nuts just crashed..."
