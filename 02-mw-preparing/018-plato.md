Plato is missing. The correct direction is the swamp.

# Swamp?
[Behind the bridge, guarded by Humbert.](010-humbert.md)

# I have passed Humbert
Then you must [have saved Ursula](015-saving-ursula.md), too!

# I saved her!
Then Plato is standing there next to this bike. You might have to visit some other place once and then walk back to the swamp. Just pick up the packages from the ground. Read [where to deliver the letters and packages](025-delivery.md).
