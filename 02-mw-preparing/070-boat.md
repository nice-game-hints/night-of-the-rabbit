Spitzweg ordered a boat from the Hedgehog brothers. After talking to Spitzweg the brothers appear to the edge of town.

# They've lost the tools
[Help them to find the tools.](080-tools.md) Give the tools to the brothers.

# They won't take them
You have to [stop the leprechaun](090-greenhat.md) first.

# And, he's gone
Give the tools to the brothers.
