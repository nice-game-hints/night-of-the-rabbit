The Hedgehog brothers won't build the boat unless the greenhat is chased away. First, [get the tools back](080-tools.md).

# I have the tools
Great, talk to the brothers. They won't take the tools back. You should drive the leprechaun away.

# How?
You see he is running through the small tunnel between the roots. Look at the tunnel.

# Block his way?
Yes. Block that tunnel.

# With what?
There is a old fence picket next to the boat and the river.

# I have it
Use that to block the tunnel. Jerry will use the tools to block the tunnel with the fence picket.

# Blocked!
Chase the leprechaun again until it bumps to your fence.

# He went home!
He is in the weird pumpkin, next to the post horn. The brothers still don't take the tools.

# What to do?
Just examine the weird pumpkin without any tools. And, he's gone!
