You got [pass the bridge](010-humbert.md) to the swamp and Ursula is in trouble!

# What to do?
Look at the antenna. Maybe you could flick it to scare the bird away.

# Can't reach
Do you spot anything you could use for help?

# The boot?
The shoelace on the boot should work. Take the shoelace and use it on the antenna.

# A hook!
Well, that should work for the antenna as well. Use the grappling hook on the antenna.

# Rats! Not close enough.
Maybe you could lure the bird close to the antenna.

# With what?
The birds like to eat cupcakes, I think. Give the dryed out cupcake to it.

# It is close
Flick the antenna again with the grappling hook.
