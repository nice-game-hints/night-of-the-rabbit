You have to first [get into the wood dwarf home](150-dwarves-house.md).
Steinberg has a really bad dwarf cold. Talk to him. He says that only Anja could help him.

# Back to the Cafe!
Take the gate key and open the front gate with it. Then go an tell Anja (ring the bell) about Steinberg.

# A recipe
Anja gives you a doctor's prescription. You need to give her following things:
 - Yellow marsh marigold bud ^[ You can find a marsh marigold at the marsh, near Plato. ]
 - [Fish scale](170-fishscale.md)
 - Some pepper ^[ Spitzweg gave you some indian white pepper. ]

# Ready!
Now you just have to mix it with something drinkable.
Mix the drinkable with the medicine in [the mug](045-mug.md).

# He is picky
Yeah, dwarves don't like coffee (did you try that?). They like [blue juice](100-blue-juice-keg.md). 

# I have some blue juice!
Mix the blue juice with the medicine in the mug. Give it to Steinberg.

# He can't move
Picky patient. You need to give it to him some other way. Give it like to a small child.

# Small child?
Pour it into the spoon and spoon-feed it to him. You can now move through the tunnel 47.
