My coffee keeps getting cold before I reach Plato!

# Why?
You are taking too long route to the swamp.

# Too long?
There ought to be faster route. Like a tunnel or something.

# Tunnel?
Have you [helped Steinberg the dwarf](160-help-dwarf.md), already?

# He is cured
Then you have a shortcut from the Cafe to the dwarf house!

# And?
The coffee won't get cold, as the route is faster! Pour some hot coffee into the mug and get to the swamp through the tunnel. Your coffee is still hot when you reach the bike.
