When you [find Plato](018-plato.md) he can't deliver the packages. You can do it!

# What and where?
There are two packages and two letters.

 - The pink package ^[ This goes to Edith at the town square. ]
 - The heavy package ^[ This goes to Mr. Churchmouse behind the town hall. ]
 - The perfumed letter ^[ This goes to Ludwig, the DJ at the cafe table. ]
 - The magical letter ^[ There is the strange mailbox next to the strange door with the spiral at the edge of the town. ]
