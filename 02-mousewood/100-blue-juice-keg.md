There is a full blue juice keg [at the swamp](010-humbert.md) in the vending machine!

# It costs
Yes, it costs _two_ leafbucks. [Have you got any?](030-money.md)

# I don't have enough
You have a second coin, you know. Your magic coin.

# But I don't want to lose it!
Have you talked with Mr. Churchmouse? Behind the town hall. Talk to him and he will give you a red thread and tie it into your magic coin.

# Neat
Now you can use the magic coin in the thread to "buy" the blue juice keg from the wending machine.
