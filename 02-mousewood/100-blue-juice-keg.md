There is a full blue juice keg [at the swamp](010-humbert.md)!

# I see it
You have your magic coin.

# But I don't want to lose it!
Have you talked with Mr. Churchmouse? Talk to him about what you would like to buy and he will give you a red thread and tie it into your magic coin.

# Neat
Now you can use the magic coin in the thread to "buy" the blue juice keg from the wending machine.
