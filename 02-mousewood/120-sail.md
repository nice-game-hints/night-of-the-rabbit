Spitzweg is setting sail as soon as the boat is ready. You can join him.
[Help the Hedgehog brothers to build the boat.](080-tools.md)

# The boat is ready!
Does it have:
 - An anchor ^[ Use the grappling hook as the anchor in the boat. ]
 - A rudder ^[ Use the silver spoon you found from the leprechaun's home. ]

# Yes, they are in order
And you have [got rid of the catfish](115-catfish.md)?

# We are sailing
Sail downstream.
