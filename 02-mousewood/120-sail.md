Spitzweg (the adventuring squirrel) is setting sail as soon as the boat is ready. You can join him.
[Help the Hedgehog brothers to build the boat.](070-boat.md)

# The boat is ready!
Next you have to [get rid of the catfish](115-catfish.md).

# The catfish is sleeping with the fishes
Um, okay. You need to equip the boat with:
 - A rudder ^[ Use the silver spoon you found from the leprechaun's home. ]
 - An anchor ^[ Use the grappling hook as the anchor in the boat. ]

# We are sailing
Sail downstream.

# Humbert!
