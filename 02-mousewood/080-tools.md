The Hedgehog brothers are missing their tools. They suspect _a greenhat_ has stolen them.

# How to find them?
Use your magic coin to look more closely.

# A leprechaun!
Follow it. Follow it everywhere it goes!

# It goes and goes
So first follow it to behind the Town hall. Then follow it to the Hares garden. Then follow it back to the ... Edge of Town.

# He is going circle!
You should stop him at some point.

# How?
Best place for a _trap_ is at the garden on the flagstone with cloverleaf where he will be stomping with his foot.

# What kind of trap?
The good old one from movies.

# What?
Put the rake ^[ You find the rake at the garden, next to the party goer.] on the flagstone. Chase the leprechaun there, again. Pick up the stolen tools. Give them back to the brothers.
