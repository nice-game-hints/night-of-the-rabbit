The Hedgehog brothers are missing their tools. They suspect _a greenhat_ has stolen them.

# How to find them?
Use your magic coin (space bar or from inventory) to look more closely.

# A leprechaun!
Follow it. Follow it everywhere it goes! ^[ First, behind the town hall, then to the gardens. ]

# It goes around
So first follow it to behind the Town hall. Then follow it to the Hares garden. Then follow it back to the ... Edge of Town. You are back where you started.

# He is going circle!
You should stop him at some point.

# Where?
Best place for a _trap_ is at the garden on the flagstone with cloverleaf where he will be stomping with his foot.

# What kind of trap?
The good old one from movies.

# What?
Put the rake ^[ You find the rake at the garden, next to the sleeping party goer.] on the flagstone. Chase the leprechaun there, again. Pick up the stolen tools. Give them back to the brothers.
