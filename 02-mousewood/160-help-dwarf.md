You have to first [get into the wood dwarf home](150-dwarves-house.md).
Steinberg has got a cold. Talk to him. He says that only Anja could help him.

# Back to the Cafe!
Take the gate key and open the front gate with it. Then go an tell Anja (ring the bell) about Steinberg.

# A recipe
Anja gives you a doctor's prescription. You need to give her following things:
 - Yellow marsh marigold bud ^[ You can find a marsh marigold at the marsh, near Plato. ]
 - [Fish scale](170-fishscale.md)
 - Some pepper ^[ Spitzweg gave you some indian white pepper. ]

# Ready!
Now you just have to mix it with something drinkable.

# Like?
Like with [blue juice](100-blue-juice-keg.md). 

# I have the blue juice keg!
Great, pour some of the juice into [the mug](045-mug.md).

# Okay
Then put the medicine powder into the mug with the juice. Give it to Steinberg.

# He doesn't take it
He can't move. You need to give it to him some other way.

# How?
Pour it into the spoon and spoon-feed it to him.
