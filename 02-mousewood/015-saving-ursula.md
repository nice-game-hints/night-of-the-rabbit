You got [pass the bridge](050-humbert.md) to the swamp. Ursula is in trouble!

# What to do?
Maybe you could lure the bird further from Ursula.

# With what?
The birds like to eat cupcakes, I think. Give the dryed out cupcake to it.

# It pecks it now!
But it won't let you near Ursula, still.

# What next?
Maybe you could flick the antenna to scare it away.

# Can't reach
Do you spot anything you could use for help?

# The boot?
The shoelace on the boot should work. Take the shoelace and use it on the antenna.

# A hook!
Well, that should work for the antenna as well. Use the grappling hook on the antenna.
