Humbert is blocking your access to the Coldwater Brook bridge. He demands a troll!

# A toll, you mean?
Yes, that's what I said. You don't have any money. Maybe you could bribe him.

# With what?
Listen to him complain. What is he talking about, all the time?

# Don't get it
He wants dessert! He only eats unhealthy sweets.

# Sweets?
Did you talk to Anja already at the Cafe? Did you talk to her on the Pharmacy side? ^[ Ring the pharmacy bell (right one) in the Cafe. Anja gives you a lollipop. ]

# I have the lollipop
Maybe that would help.

# But it's sugar-free!
Make it sweeter. It doesn't have to be sugar, you know.

# Where?
Get some honey onto the lollipop by using it on the beehive at the edge of town.

# It's sweet now
Give it to Humbert.
