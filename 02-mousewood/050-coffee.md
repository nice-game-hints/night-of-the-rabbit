There is a coffee maker in the Treetrunk Cafe.

# It is not working
You would need a mug.

# Where?
It all makes sense after you [find Plato](018-plato.md).

# I have his packages and letters
Read all the packages and letters carefully. Especially the perfumed letter.

# Perfumed letter
The perfumed letter is for Ludwig, at the Cafe. Give the perfumed letter to him.

# A complementary mug!
Use the mug on the coffee maker. You have a cup of coffee.
