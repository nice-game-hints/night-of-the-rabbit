After [setting sail](120-sail.md) Humbert again requires a toll from you. If Humbert is demanding a _bridge_ toll from you, check [the bridge toll hints](010-humbert.md).

# We are sailing
Great. You don't have 400 leafbucks. You have to come up with something else.

# What?
Did Humbert say that Anja is his babysitter?

# Yes, he did
Maybe you could convince Anja to come up with some other activity to Humbert than river piracy.

# Like?
Violin?

# Hmm...
Give Anja (at the Cafe) the violin teaching flyer you got from the backpack mouse after saving Ursula.

# She took it
Get back to the boat and sail downstream.
