After [setting sail](120-sail.md) Humbert again requires a toll from you. If you haven't yet bypassed Humbert to use the bridge, check [the first hints](010-humbert.md).

# We are sailing
Great. You don't have 400 leafbucks. You have to come up with something else.

# What?
Did Humbert say that Anja is his babysitter?

# Yes?
Maybe you could convince Anja to come up with some other activity to Humbert than river piracy.

# Like?
Violin?

# Hmm...
Give Anja (at the Cafe) the violin teaching flyer you got from the backpack mouse.

# Gave it
Get back to the boat and sail downstream.
