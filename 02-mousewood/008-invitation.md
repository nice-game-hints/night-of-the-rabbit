You would need to send the invitation letters to everyone in Mousewood. Marquis gives you the ancient letter and the magical stamp.

# How about the envelope?
It starts with [finding Plato](018-plato.md). Deliver the perfumed letter.

# To whom?
To Ludwig, the DJ at the Cafe table. He will leave the envelope on the table.

# I have it
Combine the old invitation into the envelope. Plato only accepts [sealed](190-seal.md) and stamped ^[ After it is sealed, use the magic stamp on it ] envelopes, though. You also need to [deliver all the packages](025-delivery.md) you got from Plato before he will deliver the invitations.

# I have delivered them
Great! Give the giant pile of invitations to him to get them delivered.
