_The three more things: tree skin, tree fruit and lastly, but not least, a root._

# Three, again
Put those other three things inside the mug. The order has to be right.
 1. Tree skin ^[ The bark you got from the magician. ]
 2. Tree fruit ^[ Turn the stone until you see the nets with acorns on the top views. Take them. ]
 3. [A root](055-root.md)
