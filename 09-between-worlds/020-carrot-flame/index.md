_This is the second time for carrot flame. If you are at the very beginning of the game, go_ [_here_](/01-intro/02-carrot-flame/index.md).
You have to do the carrot flame, again! You still have the poem in your inventory.

# How was it?
It has multiple steps:
 - [After drawing on rock a symbol all in white](010-draw-rock.md) - [grinding white to powder makes it right.](020-grind.md)
 - [Then add black in turn, the kind you should be loath to burn.](030-black.md)
 - [Black and white as they combine, the inside of your vessel line.](040-vessel.md)
 - [The three more things: tree skin, tree fruit and lastly, but not least, a root.](050-three.md)
 - [At the crossroads, draw a circle with the powder mix obtained, put vessel in the center of the powder ring thus gained.](060-circle.md)
 - [Set the circle - bang! - on fire, the carrot flame leaps high and higher, and I will swallow it in haste to enjoy the lovely taste.](070-bang.md)
