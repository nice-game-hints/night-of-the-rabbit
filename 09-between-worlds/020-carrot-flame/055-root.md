title: A root
---

One of the three more things in the poem is _a root_.

# A root
Oh, I wish the dwarves would be here.

# But the are!
Oh the rusty metal door (turn the stone until you see it). Pry it open.

# How?
Use your trusty weapon, for the last time.

# You mean?
The stick. Use it and you get a beet root.
