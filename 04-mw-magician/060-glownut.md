Glownuts look cool and emit light that attracts the fireflies. Talk to the Night Watchman (**night**) in front of the magician's door to learn more.

# Hare family...
They are expensive, yes. You would have to belong to an influential family, like the Hare family. Talk to the grumpy garden owner hare (**night**).

# He is grumpy
Maybe getting into their family is too much. Maybe it is enough to [get into their party](050-party.md)

# I got invited into the party!
Great! It is a great party. And there are those party lights.
