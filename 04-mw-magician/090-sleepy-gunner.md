**(night)** The gunner at the front gate is really sleepy. He would need a cup of strong coffee.

# But Anja's
Yes, Anja's Cafe is closed during night. [Maybe you could get access into it.](020-cafe-night.md)

# I can get there by night
**(night)** Good, get him some coffee then. It stays warm this time, I promise.

# I cannot use the cannon!
Nobody can use the cannon! [Except you, of course.](095-cannon.md)
