**(night)** Mr. Churchmouse Junior is... err... performing on stage. Talk to Mr. Churchmouse and show how the waternut works. Ask to borrow the waternut.

# He won't let me
You have to show him a show that makes the audience laugh.

# Jokes!
Go tell some really good jokes on the stage.

# They are not laughing
You need [professional jokes](105-jokes.md). Mr. Churchmouse gives you a pen and paper to collect better jokes.

# I have three full jokes!
Nice. Go tell them to the audience.
