The wooden statue cannot be approached with the rockwhisper spell. You have to wake it up otherwise.

# It doesn't speak
You have to find it's soul.

# Where?
Did you spot the stone-made fox statues on the left?

# Yes?
Talk to them using the rockwhisper spell.

# Cryptic
Not so. You can talk every one of them individually.

# And then?
They tell you who is the correct one. They say if the gatekeeper is sleeping above or right or left of them.

# Okay, what is the correct one?
Talk with the rockwhisper spell to the fox statue on the top row second from the left.
