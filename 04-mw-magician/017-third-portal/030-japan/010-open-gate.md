The gate is closed. Maybe the large wooden statue is a gatekeeper. [Wake it up.](005-wakeup.md)

# It is awake
It doesn't see you, but it knows you are a human. And humans cannot pass the gate.

# What to do?
It can _hear_ you and smell you.

# Hear?
Take the [little bell](005-bell.md) and use it to the statue.
