There is a poet next to the frog pond looking for inspiration.

# Where is it?
I don't know. But you will give it back to him.

# How?
He wants to see some life in the pond.

# The pond?
In the _frog_ pond.

# Frog? Plato?
Use the clicker on the pond.

# He is not getting it
Do it again. The frog will jump back into the pond.
