**(night)** The gunner won't let you use the cannon. He will wake up if you try to touch it.

# He needs coffee
Yes.. would that make him sleepy? [You can try,](090-sleepy-gunner.md)

# On the contrary
But you got [the access to Anja's Cafe](020-cafe-night.md), right?

# Right
Could you make some kind of _anti-coffee_?

# Anti-coffee?
You had those valerian drops causing sleepiness with you.

# Right!
**(night)** Pour some coffee for him at the cafe and mix valerian drops into the coffee. Give it to the gunner. You can now do whatever you want with the cannon.

# Whatever?
Well, you cannot shoot the peas. I can recommend one ammo over others.

# What?
[Glownuts!](060-glownut.md)

# I have a glownut!
Oh! Shoot one with the cannon! Beautiful, isn't it!

# He is not shooting...
You need a reason to light up the whole area up.

# What reason?
Go seek [the portals](015-second-portal/index.md). After advancing more he gets a good reason to shoot the glownut.
