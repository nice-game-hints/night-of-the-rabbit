**(night)** The gunner won't let you use the cannon. He will wake up if you try to touch it.

# He needs coffee
Yes.. would that make him sleepy? [You can try,](090-sleepy-gunner.md)

# On the contrary
Could you make some kind of _anti-coffee_?

# Anti-coffee?
You had those valerian drops causing sleepiness with you.

# Right!
Pour some coffee for him and mix valerian drops into the coffee. Give it to the gunner. You can now do whatever you want with the cannon.

# Whatever?
Well, you cannot shoot the peas. I can recommend one ammo over others.

# What?
