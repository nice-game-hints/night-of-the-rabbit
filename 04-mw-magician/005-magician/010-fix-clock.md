You have [access to the clock](../005-getting-to-clock.md)?

# I am there
If you screw the metal knob the cuckoo will activate.

# It's muted!
Look at the bellows on the right side.

# Hmm...
That is the thing that makes the sound. The metal arm is unattached from it.

# It is stuck!
What do you do to stuck metal hinges?

# What?
You oil them, of course.

# Oil?
There is a drop of oil in the clock. Above the metal knob.

# I don't touch it with my bare hands
Naturally. Find something that you can use for that.

# What?
There is a napkin on the edge of the cup with milk. Take it and use it on the drop of oil.

# Oily napkin
Now you can oil the metal arm and attach it to the bellows. You get a key-shaped clock part. Interesting. Activate the cuckoo from the metal knob.
