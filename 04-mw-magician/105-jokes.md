You have talked with Mr. Churchmouse about jokes, already? And got a pen and paper to collect better jokes?

# Yes
Great, now just hunt someone with jokes.

# Whoo?
Whooo, indeed.

# You mean?
Didn't Jonathan, at the town hall **(day)** try to tell a joke?

# But Conrad
He is blocking the jokes. Maybe you should approach Jonathan during the **night**.

# Where?
**(night)** He is attending [the Hare family birthday party](050-party.md).

# I got in!
Now talk to him, he will tell you three jokes.

# But the punchlines!
Um, yeah. You only have half of the jokes now. You should now find someone to finish the jokes.

# Who?
Who is the other funny guy in Mousewood? Everybody has _heard_ of him.

# You mean...
Ludwig the radio DJ, of course! He is at the party but he is too _off the air_ during the night.

# So
**(day)** Visit him at the radio station / swamp. Show him the half jokes to get the punchlines.
