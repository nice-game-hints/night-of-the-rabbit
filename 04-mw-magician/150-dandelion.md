**(day)** There are dandelion parachutes flying behind the dwarf house.

# How to catch them?
The forked branch would work as a great dandelion catcher.

# Can't reach
Use your trusty tools.

# What?
The grappling hook. Attach it to the branch.

# What next?
You need more power to pull the branch into a position. What powerful machine there would be near?

# Power?
Take the shoelace and put it into the window.

# It is in
Stop the machine from the switch and attach the shoelace on the large flywheel.

# It is tied
Start the machine from the switch. The branch is now in position.

# It is not catching
You would need something that catches stuff.

# Like?
Like a spider web ^[ **(night)** You get the spider web next to the first portal tree. ]

# Can't attach it
You would need to add something sticky to the branch.

# Sticky?
Like [beet syrup](055-cake/020-beet-syrup.md).

# I have it
Now, just a tool to spread it to the branch.

# A tool?
Get back to this problem when you have entered through [the fourth portal entrance](019-fourth-portal/010-entrance.md).

# I was there over the treetops
And you saw the moth high priestess? Did you spot the bundle of flax laying on the railing?

# Yes, I have it
**(day)** Use the flax on the beet syrup tap or mug. Then with the brush with the syrup use it on the bent branch.

# It is sticky now
You can now attach the spider web there.

# It is not catching the parachutes
Go adjust the shoelace inside the hut.

# Oh, snap!
You have a dandelion caught in the net.

# How do I get it?
Use the your stick.

# No?
First, attach the flax into the stick. Then you can use the brush to take the dandelion parachute.
