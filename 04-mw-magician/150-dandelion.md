**(day)** There are dandelion parachutes flying behind the dwarf house.

# How to catch them?
The forked branch would work as a great dandelion catcher.

# Can't reach
Use your trusty tools.

# What?
The grappling hook. Attach it to the branch.

# What next?
You need more power to pull the branch into a position. What powerful machine there would be near?

# Power?
Take the shoelace and put it into the window.

# It is in
Stop the machine from the switch and attach the shoelace on the large flywheel.

# It is tied
Start the machine from the switch. The branch is now in position.

# It is not catching
You would need something that catches stuff.

# Like?
Like a spider web ^[ **(night)** You get the spider web next to the first portal tree. ]

# Can't attach it
You would need to add something sticky to the branch.

# Sticky?
[broken](tbd)
