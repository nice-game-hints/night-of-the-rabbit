_This is a guide for the second time you are in Mousewood. You cannot drain the path when you are prearing the festival._

# With what?
Maybe with something that will soak all the water away.

# Like?
Like [a waternut](100-waternut.md).

# I have it
**(day)** Put it into the flooded path.

# It does not suck up the water
It should be bigger...

# Bigger?
You would need magic. [Learn some spells](015-second-portal/index.md), first.

# I know the spell
Use Greengrow spell on the waternut to make it grow.
