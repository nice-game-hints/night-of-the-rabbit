First, clear [the first portal](../013-first-portal/index.md).
The second portal is behind the little green man. You just have to find him first.

# Where to?
He is invisible, you know? Go look for him, he is noisy. Especially during the **day**.

# I think I found him
**(day)** In the gardens, yes. He is singing.

# Can't see him, though
Use your magic coin to make him visible.

# I can see him
But he thinks he doesn't see you.

# What to do
Steal his clothes. Meet him during the **night** on [top of the town hall](010-top-town-hall.md).
