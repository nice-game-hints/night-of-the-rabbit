**(night)** After you talk with the little green man he will meet you at the top of the town hall. The branch is blocking you as it is too bright.

# How to make more light?
Have you seen how the town is light up? Talk to the guard at the magician's door about them.

# What are the light sources?
Glownuts. [You should get one for yourself.](../060-glownut.md)

# I have a glownut
Great! Now spill the juice from the glownut on the branch to get more light there.

# The glownut is too heavy
Maybe you could find something with more _force_ to break the glownut on the branch.

# Any more hints?
When you look from the top of the town hall into the view below. What do you see? That view has the answer.

# Hmm.. I see the city wall? What else?
The city wall, yes. And one of the _cannons_ guarding the city.

# Tell me what to do with the cannon
[Use the cannon](../095-cannon.md) to fire up the glownut to the tree branch. Point the cannon before shooting towards the tree branch. Then use the glownut on the cannon to light up the branch.
