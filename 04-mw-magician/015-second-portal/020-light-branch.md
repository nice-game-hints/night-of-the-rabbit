After you talk with the little green man he will meet you at the top of the town hall. The branch is blockin you as it is too bright.

# How to make more light?
Have you seen how the town is light up? Talk to the guard at the magician's door about them.

# What are they?
Glownuts. [You should get one for yourself.](../060-glownut.md)

# I have a glownut
Great! Now spill the juice from it on the branch to get more light there.

# It is too heavy
You need to improvise to get the juice spilled on the branch.

# How?
Look around you from the rooftop. What do you see?

# Hmm.. city wall?
And one of the cannons.

# Interesting...
[Use the cannon](095-cannon.md) to fire up the glownut to the tree branch. Point the cannon before shooting towards the tree branch. Then use the glownut on the cannon to light up the branch.
