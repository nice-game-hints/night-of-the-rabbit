The green man is in bad mood. He will only teach you the spell if you make him happy. He wants something special... and shiny.

# Shiny?
Look through your inventory.

# Shiny and special...
How about the trophy?

# Well, it is special
Give it to him.

# He doesn't want it
Oh, he wants to find it himself.

# So?
You could leave it somewhere for him to find.

# Like?
The tower window. Take the old flag first away and then put the trophy on the window from _outside_ the tower.

# It isn't shiny enough
Polish it.

# With what?
The old flag. Use the old flag on the trophy when it is sitting on the window.

# He took it
And he created a rainbow! Go inside the tower and touch the rainbow.
