title: Fixing the radio
---

Her radio is broken. You should fix it.

# How?
Did you already look under the tarps?

# Tarps?
There are two tarps. One right of the tent. The other one is under the radio.

# Opened them
The battery has run out. You should juice it up.

# How?
Did you talk to the god statue at the slope? ^[ Clear up the snow on top of the rock and use rockwhisper spell. ] Ask him what kind of a god is he anyway.

# Lightning!
So, he strikes the scrub with a lighting. Electricity!

# What next
Take the strings of lights. Put them on the scrub.

# Now what?
Stick the plug into the battery pack.

# More lightning!
Yes. Talk to the statue again and make it to do the lightning, again.
