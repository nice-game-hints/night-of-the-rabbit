Ask the moth priestess about the portal.

# High priestess?
It is the white statue, Moonlight. She needs nourishment.

# Nourishment
Something new to grow. To surprass the grey flood.

# What?
A new seed to the clay pot with soil in front of her.

# Where do I get a seed?
[The dandelion parachutes](../150-dandelion.md) would be perfect for the job.

# I have it
Plant it into the clay pot.

# It does not grow
Not without...

# Oh...
...magic, yes. Use the greengrow spell on the clay pot with seed. **If you enter the portal you don't get back to this Mousewood. Finish all your optional stuff before entering.**
