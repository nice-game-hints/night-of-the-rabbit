You have [wake the toad up](010-toad/index.md). Now talk with it to learn your first spell.

# It only talks about...
...streams of time. Yes.

# What should I say?
First, talk about anything. Second, ask it about streams of time ^[ "The streams of time?" ].

# Then?
I think whispering rocks are quite interesting ^[ "The whispering of the rocks?" ].

# Once more
So, click on these options:
   - Say anything... (like, "I'm Jerry Hazelnut...")
   - "The streams of time?"
   - "The whispering of the rocks?"

You get your first spell. Try it on the odd crystal statue.
