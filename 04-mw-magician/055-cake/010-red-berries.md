Anja needs red berries for the cake.

# Where to?
Did you check the Mousewood radio station?

# Yes?
There is one of the armed town guards. She has been eating only the red berries. But don't let you take them.

# What does she want?
Listen to her.

# Fondue?
Well-peppered [cheese](../080-cheese.md) fondue that is.

# I have cheese!
Great, make fondue for her.

# How?
First you need heat. Switch to **night** and she will have a campfire next to her.

# Okay
Then, you need something to make the fondue _in_. Something metallic.

# What is that?
Do you have tin foil ^[ You get it when you take the chocolate from the magician's house. ]?

# I have it!
Great. Put it in the campfire as a pot.

# It is ready
Now, just put the cheese into it. You have fondue!

# She is not eating it
It is not seasoned well enough.

# Seasoned?
Put some of your indian white pepper into it. You can now grab the red berries.
