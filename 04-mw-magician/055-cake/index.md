Anja will bake a cake for the Hare family birthday party. She just needs the ingredients:
 - [Red berries](010-red-berries.md)
 - Chocolate ^[ You find chocolate in the magician's house. ]
 - Some milk ^[ You find a giant cup of milk from the magician's house. Use your mug to get it. ]
 - [Beet syrup](020-beet-syrup.md)

# Collected those
**(day)** You have to give the ingredients to Anja. With milk and suryp you have to deliver them separately as they don't fit in the same mug. After giving Anja all the ingredients the cake will be ready when you spend a **night** and then on the next **day**. You can collect the cake from the Cafe during **day**.
