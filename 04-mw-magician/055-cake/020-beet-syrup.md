There is a really huge beet at the back of the dwarf house.

Tap some beet syrup from it into your mug.

# How?
You have the tap, right? ^[ You find the tap from the garden. Take it off from the empty keg of blue juice. ]

Insert the tap into the beet and use the mug on the tap. You have the mug full of beet syrup.
