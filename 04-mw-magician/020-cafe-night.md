Anja's Cafe is closed by night. There is a way in, though.

# What way?
The backdoor, of course. Could you get it to be unlocked? You can't steal the key.

# How?
During the **day** the mouse with the backpack is moving in and out of the cafe. He will unlock and then lock the door again.

# So?
You could fool him to think it is locked. He is totally lost in tought. Look at your inventory.

# With what?
The key-shaped clock part.

# What to do with it?
When the mouse exits put the clock part on top of the key. You can now enter the cafe even by night.
