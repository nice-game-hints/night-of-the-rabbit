**(night)** The Hare family is having a birthday party. Oh, how nice it would be to attend it. Have you talked to the grumpy gardened guarding the port there?

# Yup
Did you ask "What are you celebrating?"

# Yes, they are missing something
They are waiting for Anja to make them a cake. **(day)** You should go ask Anja about the cake in the Cafe.
