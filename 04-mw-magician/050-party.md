**(night)** The Hare family is having a birthday party. Oh, how nice it would be to attend it. Have you talked to the grumpy gardened guarding the port there?

# Yup
Did you ask "What are you celebrating?"

# Yes, they are missing something
They are waiting for Anja to make them a cake. **(day)** You should go ask Anja about the cake in the Cafe.

# A cake
[Get the cake from Anja.](055-cake/index.md)

# I have the cake
**(night)** Give the cake to the grumpy gardener to get access into the party. You get a trophy from the party goer.
