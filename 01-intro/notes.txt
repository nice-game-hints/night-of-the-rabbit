Carrot flame

After drawing on rock a symbol all in white - grinding white to powder makes it right.
Then add black in turn, the kind you should be loath to burn.
Black and white as they combine, the inside of your vessel line.
The three more things: tree skin, tree fruit and lastly, but not least, a root.
At the crossroads, draw a circle with the powder mix obtained, put vessel in the center of the powder ring thus gained.
Set the circle - bang! - on fire, the carrot flame leaps high and higher, and I will swallow it in haste to enjoy the lovely taste.
