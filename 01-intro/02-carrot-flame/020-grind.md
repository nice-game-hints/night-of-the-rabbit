title: Grinding white to powder... 
---

Do this first: [_After drawing on rock a symbol all in white -_](010-draw-rock.md).
After that _grinding white to powder makes it right._

# White?
The chalk, of course!

# Grinding?
You should grind the chalk to small pieces.

# With what?
The large stone on the flat stone would suffice.

# What to do?
Put the chalk on the flat stone. Pick up the heavy stone. Put it on the crumbly chalk to get chalk powder.
