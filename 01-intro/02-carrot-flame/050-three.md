_The three more things: tree skin, tree fruit and lastly, but not least, a root._

# So?
You should now have [the can with the powder mixture inside it](040-vessel.md).

# I have
Put those other three things inside the can. The order has to be right.
 1. Tree skin ^[ The bark the squirrels bought to you into the mushroom circle. ]
 2. [Tree fruit](055-tree-fruit.md)
 3. A root ^[ A carrot. You can find one in front of your house, in the carrot bed. ]
