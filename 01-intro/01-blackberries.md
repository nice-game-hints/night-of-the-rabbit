title: Collecting blackberries
---

You take the basket from the window sill. Then go and collect the blackberries from the forest crossroads. Walk all the way to the right to find the blackberry bush.

# Brumbly bush is on the way
You need a _weapon_!

# Weapon?
Did you go deeper into the woods already?

# Yes?
There is something there to use as a weapon.

# What?
The stick. Pick it up and use it on the brumbly bush.

# It is cleared.
Nice, now you can collect the blackberries.

# Except one set!
It is blocked by spider webs.

# What to do?
Your weapon?

# The stick?
Use the stick on the spider webs. You now have enough blackberries to get them to your mother.
